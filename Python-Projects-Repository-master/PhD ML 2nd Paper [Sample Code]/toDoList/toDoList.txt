1. Extract the four subsets of the PeX dataset in the .csv file format.
2. Transform the four extracted .csv files of the PeX Dataset into the "labeled" equivalent.
3. Transform "stefaniaLogsAll.csv", "T1021 [Malicious LM].csv", "T1550 [Malicious LM].csv" and as "Normal" traffic as possible .csv files of the extended PeX Dataset into the "labeled" equivalent.
4. SOS SOS SOS labeled will be made under the prism of three classes of data and not two.
3. Choose the most appropriate features for the ML experiments that will follow. 
4. Feature Selection techniques should be applied on the concatenated final labeled subset on the features that the first round of Swallow classification experiments was held.
4. Repeat the pre-processing of the extracted features with the most state of the art methods namely OHE, MinMax, LogisticRegression etc. in order to make the data compatible for ML algorithms. 
5. Re-Execute the Shallow Classification experiments first, extract the results and the confusion matrices. 
6. Re-Execute the Deep Learning experiments, collect results and confusion matrices. 
7. Execute Graph-based NN, collect results and confusion matrices. 


The labelling criterias of the End-point detection and response policy should be amended during the filtering of the log traffic.
