# ################## Relational Databases ##################

# Relational Databases model data by storing rows and columns 
# in tables. The power of the relational database lies in its 
# ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables and 
# in particular where there are multiple tables and the 
# relationships between those tables involved in the query.

# ################## Terminology ##################
# Database: Contains many table.
# Relation (or table): Contains tuples and attributes.
# Tuple (or row): A set of fiels that generally represents 
# an "object" like a person or a music track.
# Attribute (also column or fields): One of the possible many 
# elements of data corresponding to the object represented by 
# the row.

# ############## Structured Query Language (SQL) ##############
# SQL is the language we use to issue commands to the database.
# With SQL we make realy easy the CRUD processes. 
# Create - Read - Update - Delete (CRUD).

# Common Database Management Systems: Oracle, MySql, SqlServer, 
# HSQL, SQLite, Postgres...

# This is not too exchiting (so far).
# Tables pretty much look like big fast programmable spreadsheets 
# with rows, columns and commands.
# The power comes when we have more than one table and we can exploit 
# the relationships between the tables.
