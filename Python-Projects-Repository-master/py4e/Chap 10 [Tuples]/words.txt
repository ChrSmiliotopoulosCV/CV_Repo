The analysis key network analysis node identification technology plays an important role in comprehending unknown terrains and rapid action planning in network attack and defense confrontation. 
The conventional key node identification algorithm only takes one type of relationship into consideration; therefore, it is incapable of representing the characteristics of multiple relationships between nodes. 
Additionally, it typically disregards the periodic change law of network node vulnerability over time. 
In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a network key node identification method based on the vulnerability life cycle and the significance of the network topology. 
Based on the CVSS score, this paper proposes the calculation method of the vulnerability life cycle risk value, and identifies the key nodes of the network based on the importance of the network topology. 
Finally, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in the analysis selection of analysis key nodes through network instance analysis.
