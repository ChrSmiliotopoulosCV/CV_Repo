# The so called Definite Loops are called as such because they execute an
# exact - definite number of times. We say that "definite loops iterate through
# the members of a set".

# "i" is called iteration variable, which iterates through the sequence. The block of 
# the code is executed once for each value in the sequence. The iteration variable
# moves through all of the values in the sequence.

# The == operator compares the value or equality of two objects, whereas 
# the Python is operator checks whether two variables point to the same 
# object in memory. In the vast majority of cases, this means you should 
# use the equality operators == and !=, except when youâ€™re comparing to None.

# Python has an is operator that can be used in logical expressions. Implies "
# "is the same as". Similar to, but stronger than ==. is not also is a logical 
# operator.
